# WeatherApp
⛈️ A lightweight weather app for practicing my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

🥇 This is my first web app, so I decided to use native JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to learn the basics.

📲 I also practiced making API calls. I used the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API to fetch the weather data.

🎨 I styled the web app in the Tokyo Night theme because it's my favorite code editor theme, and I really like the color combinations.
